# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
**Introducing  Data Visualization to help explain data through various visualizations** 

## Overview

**Using the Penguins Dataset we developed numerous ways to visualize the dataset**

### Statastical Insights

### Boxplot

**Boxplots are a good way to check the outliers or understand the relationship between a categorical and continuous feature by showing the distribution of data.**

## Histogram

**Histograms are used to depict the frequency distribution. It can be only used with numerical data** 

<img src = "img/Histogram 1.png" >       <img src = "img/Histogram 2.png" >  

## Kdeplot

**kdepot is another way to visualize the distribution of the data.**

## Bar Plot

**In a bar plot, the x-axis represents a categorical variable while the y-axis is a numerical variable. That is why the bar plot depicts a relationship between these two variables. For instance, below the body masses of the penguins for each islands are seen. The categorical data in the x-axis is the islands whereas the numerical data in y-axis is the body mass of the penguin.**

## Cross Tab

**Crosstab is a pandas function that displays the relationship between two or more variables that can be analyzed.**

## Count Plot

**A count plot is similiar to a bar plot but used for only categorical data. It plots the cout of observations by category in form of a bar plot. It differs from a bar plot because bar plots show the mean of a feature by category**

## Violin Plot

**Violin plots have common properties with box plots and used when the objective is to observe the distribution of numerical data for different categories.It gives more insights than a box plot, because two different categories might have the same mean but it doesnâ€™t mean that they are the same. Their distributions might differ and in that case, violin plots would be more useful to observe.**

## Correlation Matrix

**Correlation Matrix is the summarization of the dataset. The matrix shows the correlations between features. In this dataset the relationship between `length of flipper` and `body mass` shows a correlation of 0.87, which is quite high.**

# Summary

**This dataset is quite small yet really useful in performing data analysis. The numerous and different visualizations play a key role in helping us understand the broader picture of datasets.**
